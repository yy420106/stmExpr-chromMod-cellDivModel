## Description

The matlab scripts in the same folder of this file, provided a program for simulation and visualization of ***STM* expression-chromatin modification-cell division coupled model**, which was utilized and described in the following research paper:

A cell cycle-dependent epigenetic Sisyphus mechanism maintains stem cell fate for shoot branching (DOI: XXX)

For detailed explanation of the model, please see the **Supplement_Computational_Methods_and_Simulation_Details.pdf**.

## Note

A more comprehensive, elegant and high-efficient CLI version has been rewritten in Python, with some new features and customized option extensions.
The output figures have also been optimized for better visualization.

Use Python version instead is highly recommanded.
